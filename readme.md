Features/tech
--------

It's a memory game, easy to use. Built with html, css, javascript





Objectives
--------

Create game wiht 16 squares, if selection is correct they stay the matched color, if incorrect
switch back to initial color.  Get a functioning reset button.


Issues
--------

Initially made game board and though it was going very well, JS proved to be a challange.  
Issues were cleaning up missed selections and restart.
Thought that by using simple code the would be easier to debug, that proved to be my biggest
mistake as everything took much longer to fix since there were so many instances of virtually the 
the same thing to correct.
